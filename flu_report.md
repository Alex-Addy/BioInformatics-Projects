The flu season is around the corner. Although the flu activity for this year might be low [CDC], but it might pick up during the holiday season. You can find more info about the flu virus for this season at: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/ . This season's vaccine protect against the following three viruses:

  1. an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus

  2. an A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)-like virus

  3. a B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus

Your task is to navigate the flu database at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/aboutdatabase.html) to identify the relationship of the isolates of H1N1, H3N2, and the B virus in the past five years. Your project includes the following parts:

  1. Just to get you started, first answer the following questions about the database:

      a. How many different types Influenza viruses have?
          3 (A,B,C)

      b. List five host species the database considers
          (Avian, Bat, Blow Fly, Bovine, Camel, Cat, Ferret)

      c. How many nucleotide segments an influenza A virus contains and how many an influenza B virus contains?
          A: 8 (PB2, PB1, PA/PA-, HA, NP, NA, MP, NS)
          B: 8 (PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP, NS)

      d. What do the subtypes H and N stand for? What do the numbers in H1N1 and H3N2 stand for?
          H : hemagglutinin, N : neuraminidase. The numbers are the specific subtype of that protein, with there being 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes. \[CDC: www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm \]

      e. What makes influenza B different from influenza A?
        The antigenic type, with the possibilities being A, B, and C. However C only causes a mild respiratory illness and "are not thought to cause epidemics"\[CDC\].

      f. Why do we have to have flu shots every year?
        The dominant strands of the flu change from year to year, meaning the immunity gained last year does not apply this year.

  2. How many full length unique nucleotide sequences of H1N1 and H3N2 isolated from people in USA from 1/1/2009 to 10/1/2014 has the database collected? How many of these collected this year?

  |                       | H1N1 | H3N2 | B virus |
  | --------------------- | ---- | -----| ------- |
  | 1/1/2009 to 10/1/2014 | 7850 | 6675 |   1799  |
  | This year             |  670 |  478 |    196  |

  3. Influenza Virus Sequence Tree. Considering unique full length protein sequences coding HA proteins in this year's H1N1 flu viruses infected people in USA, build your influenza virus sequence tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. What does the tree look like?
    The tree is very flat with most sequences being only a few levels deep.

  4. What distance did you use in part 3? Change your distance measure; how much did your tree change? What's your explanation about the difference? What can you tell your friends about this years H1N1 virus based on your trees?
    F84
    The tree had only minor changes with only a few sequences moving. The movement was mainly in having two neighbor leaf nodes swap places, a minor negligible change
    It is very similar acrossed the board and you should be fine after getting the flu shot.

  5. Repeat part 3 and 4 for H3N2 virus using the UPGMA algorithm.  This tree is deeper showing many subtrees.

  6. Repeat part 3 and 4 for combined sequences for H1N1 and H3N2 using neighbor-joining algorithm.

  7. What additional observations have you made from the tree obtained in part 6?

What to submit â€“ A Report which includes:

  Abstract - Give a brief presentation of the problem, summarize the methods, and outline your results and conclusions.

  Introduction - Detailed problem description and background knowledge of the problem. Outline approaches you take to solve the problem and present a short literature survey on the approaches you are taking. 

  Materials and methods - Description of data acquisition, including the source. Description of the methods used, including complexity analysis of the algorithms.

  Implementation - Give a high level description of your implementation of your approach.

  Results and discussion - Describe and analyze the results of your computation. Use tables or graphs wherever you can.

  Conclusion - Conclude your study. Summarize the main objectives and results, as in the introduction, but from the perspective of the readers who have read the main part of the report and need reminding what it is all about. 

  References - Give detailed references to the sources of information. References should be actually referred to in the text. For example write "see ref. 16" if you want to refer to a book/paper for an idea you present in the report.
