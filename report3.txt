	The goal of this project was to take a closer look at different versions of the flu and compare them to each other.  More specifically we will be looking at the H1N1 strain, H3N2 strain, and the B strain.  
	The objectives with our in depth look will require us to study up on the influenza viruses, look at the databases, build sequence trees using the neighbor-joining algorithm.  Beyond that, we will modify those trees and look at the observable changes.  We will also make some comparisons using UPGMA.
	Our data will come from the flu database at NCBI.  Our observations and comparisons can be found in our other paper that talks about the results of our project.
