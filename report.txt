Your report should include the following sections:

1.     Description of PCR, you might want to include some nice pictures;

2.     The data structures and/or algorithms you used in your computer program, with justifications for your choices, you may want to include some diagrams;

3.     Discuss any implementation difficulties you encountered, and how you overcame them.

4.     Results.

5.     Discuss your results. How do the numbers you obtain from the simulation related to what you see on the gel which shows the PCR products.





1.  PCR, or Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a process used to create a large number of copies of part of a DNA strand.  The number of copies can order into the thousands or even millions.  The process is used in areas such as DNA cloning for sequencing and study of hereitary diseases.  The process consists of three steps: denaturation, annealing, extension.  During denaturation the source DNA strand is heathed up to split up the strand into it's complementary parts.  Next during annealing a primer is attached to the seperated strands.  The primer is designed to bind to a location on the DNA strand around the area that is being coppied.  This has to be an area where there is a sequence that is not repeated anywhere else in the DNA strand or else the primer may bind to the wrong location.  In the final step Taq polymerase is used to generate complementary bases to the strand being coppied.  This cycle is repeat over and over until the desired amount of copies are made.  The process creates new strands at an exponental rate however there is a chance that a Taq polymerase may fall off prematurly creating a reject strand.

3.	Our initial implementation was only for a single strand of DNA.  We didn't realize that we needed to simulate both strands.  A lot of our functions were initially made with that in mind.  Locating the index of the primers became difficult because of that as we did not want to increase the complexity of the program but we also did not want to throw away the code we already wrote.  Our solution was to reverse the second strand with the primer that runs in reverse so our functions would be able to work their algorithms on it and at the end we reverse it all again to bring it back to it's original state.
