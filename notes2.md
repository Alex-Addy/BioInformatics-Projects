Make sure to use resources to find coding regions.

Synonymous mutations: base pair change where the resulting protein does not change
Non-synonymous mutations: base pair change where the resulting protein does change

For checking for mutations just look at codons in groups of three starting from the start 
of the string

Align gene to gene
